"""Swap MCP server configs across every installed agent CLI.

Use when you want every installed agent CLI to run a local checkout of an
MCP server (editable) instead of a pinned release. ``use-local`` rewrites
each CLI's config to invoke the checkout via ``uv --directory <repo> run
<entry>``, or a pull request's head via ``uvx`` with ``--pr``; ``revert``
restores from the timestamped backup the swap wrote.
Swapping a layer that is already swapped keeps that first backup rather
than taking a new one, so ``revert`` always lands on the pre-swap config.

Defaults are derived from the current repo's ``pyproject.toml``:

- server name = ``project.name`` with a trailing ``-mcp`` stripped
  (``libtmux-mcp`` -> ``libtmux``)
- entry command = first key of ``[project.scripts]``

Examples
--------
```console
$ uv run Scripts/mcp_swap.py detect
$ uv run Scripts/mcp_swap.py status
$ uv run Scripts/mcp_swap.py use-local --dry-run
$ uv run Scripts/mcp_swap.py use-local
$ uv run Scripts/mcp_swap.py use-local --pr 115
$ uv run Scripts/mcp_swap.py revert
```

Scope
-----
This script is best-effort and intentionally narrow:

- **One selected transaction.** ``use-local`` and ``revert`` read and plan every
  selected config, backup, and state destination before staging any write.
  Commits recheck paths, symlinks, modes, bytes, and file identities; failures
  roll back in reverse and retain any recovery artifact that is still needed.

- **Owned recovery.** Versioned, bounded state records the expected swapped
  config and backup identities. Later edits, replacements, or symlink changes
  stop ``revert`` rather than being overwritten. ``--dry-run`` performs the
  same read-only plan without build preflight, temporary files, or writes.

- **Global configs only.** Writes to ``~/.cursor/mcp.json``,
  ``~/.claude.json``, ``~/.codex/config.toml``,
  ``~/.gemini/settings.json``, ``~/.grok/config.toml`` (TOML
  ``mcp_servers``, same shape as Codex),
  ``~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`` (agy / Antigravity CLI, JSON
  ``mcpServers`` — the shared-config file the CLI reads, sibling to the
  ``config.json`` it loads at startup),
  ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/opencode.jsonc`` (JSONC ``mcp``, comments
  preserved) and ``~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`` (JSONC too -- the adapter that
  reads it strips comments). Workspace / project-local
  configs (``$PWD/.cursor/mcp.json``, ``$PWD/.gemini/settings.json``,
  ``$PWD/opencode.json``, per-project ``projects.<abs>.mcpServers``
  entries inside ``~/.claude.json`` *are* recognised for Claude only)
  are NOT walked — workspace files for the others are silently ignored.
  When workspace precedence matters, run the CLI's own
  ``cursor mcp add ...`` / ``gemini mcp add ...`` directly. opencode has
  no non-interactive project-scope add -- ``opencode mcp add`` writes the
  global file -- so edit ``$PWD/opencode.json`` by hand for that.

- **opencode reads three global files.** ``config.json``,
  ``opencode.json`` and ``opencode.jsonc`` in the same directory are all
  loaded and merged, with ``.jsonc`` winning. This script owns
  ``.jsonc`` — the file opencode itself writes to — so its entry is the
  one that takes effect. A stale ``mcp.<name>`` left in a sibling
  ``opencode.json`` still merges underneath rather than being shadowed
  outright; remove it by hand if that matters.

- **pi has no MCP client of its own.** Its README says so, and the
  released build ships no MCP code. ``~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`` is read by
  the third-party ``pi-mcp-adapter`` extension, so a swap written there
  takes effect only once that package is installed. ``detect`` says as
  much rather than reporting a swap that cannot do anything.

- **Claude scope.** ``use-local`` and ``revert`` accept
  ``--scope {user,project}``. The default ``project`` writes the
  per-project entry under ``projects[<abs-repo>].mcpServers`` —
  only the current repo's directory sees the swap, matching
  pre-flag behaviour. ``--scope user`` writes Claude's top-level
  ``mcpServers`` fallback so every project that has no per-project
  override picks up the swap; useful when QA-ing a branch across
  many directories. Every other CLI here has no per-project layer in
  the config file this script writes; the flag is silently coerced to
  ``user`` for them. Both Claude scopes can coexist with
  independent backups; full ``revert`` unwinds in LIFO order.
- **Simple binary detection.** Probing is ``shutil.which(<binary>)``
  plus ``<config_path>.exists()``. Custom install locations
  (Homebrew, npm prefixes, ``~/.npm-global/bin``,
  ``~/.claude/local/claude``, ``~/.gemini/local/gemini``) are picked
  up only if the binary is on ``PATH``. FastMCP's installer probes
  these locations directly; this script does not.
- **Single config shape per CLI.** No fallback paths, no merge of
  multiple sources. If your setup deviates from the defaults above,
  use the CLI's native ``mcp`` subcommand instead.

# tomlkit gives TOML a format-preserving round trip; JSONC has no
# equivalent on PyPI that is safe to depend on here. ``json-five`` was
# measured first and rejected: it raises on ``"C:\\x"`` and silently
# decodes the literal six characters ``\u0041`` to ``"A"`` — both valid
# JSON that stdlib reads correctly, and the second is exactly the silent
# rewrite this script exists to avoid.
#
# So values come from stdlib ``json`` (correct escape semantics) and
# edits are applied as text splices located by an offset-preserving
# scanner. Every byte outside a replaced value survives untouched, which
# is the same technique opencode's own config writer uses via
# ``jsonc-parser``'s ``modify()``.

_JSON_WS = " \t\n\r"
